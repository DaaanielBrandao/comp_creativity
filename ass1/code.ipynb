    "For the fitness function we wanted to encourage interesting recipes and ingredients, while keeping the recipes with the type of ingredients necessary to make it work. We used the following article, [How Ingredients Behave In A Cookie Recipe](https://www.instructables.com/How-Ingredients-Behave-In-A-Cookie-Recipe/), to get some insight on how different roles of ingredients interact to form the final cookie. The article mentions mandatory rules that apply to the making of every cookie: \n",
    "- \"The rule of thumb for cookie baking is to always keep the amount of fat and sugar used relatively equal. There should be less than 1/4 cup difference between the two\" - One of the fitness parameters for the recipes is how similiar are the fat and sugar quantities of the recipe\n",
    "- \"The amount of flour used should be about two times the amount of fat\" - The second fitness parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the recipe achievable and believable we also want to limit the number of the flavoring ingredients by having a lower and upper limit. If the recipe steps outside the boundary this fitness parameter is reduced based on how much it is out of the boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the recipe interesting, rare items are encouradged by having a fitness parameter that is based on the average rarity of all the ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this parameters have a multiplier that can be tuned to change how much each fitness parameter affects the final fitness score\n"
