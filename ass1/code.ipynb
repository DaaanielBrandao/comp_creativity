    "For the fitness function we wanted to encourage interesting recipes and ingredients, while keeping the recipes with the type of ingredients necessary to make it work. We used the following article, [How Ingredients Behave In A Cookie Recipe](https://www.instructables.com/How-Ingredients-Behave-In-A-Cookie-Recipe/), to get some insight on how different roles of ingredients interact to form the final cookie. The article mentions mandatory rules that apply to the making of every cookie: \n",
    "- \"The rule of thumb for cookie baking is to always keep the amount of fat and sugar used relatively equal. There should be less than 1/4 cup difference between the two\" - One of the fitness parameters for the recipes is how similiar are the fat and sugar quantities of the recipe\n",
    "- \"The amount of flour used should be about two times the amount of fat\" - The second fitness parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The foundation of any cookie recipe consists of five types of ingredients: fat, sugar, flour, a rising agent, and a binding agent.\" - Another fitness parameter, every cookie should have at least one ingredient in each essential role.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the recipe interesting and believable we also want to limit the number of the flavoring ingredients by having a lower and upper limit. If the recipe steps outside the boundary this fitness parameter is reduced based on how much it is out of the boundary.\n",
    "Since we are dealing with cookie recipes, they should be somewhat simple and not have too many total ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the recipe interesting, rare items are encouradged by having a fitness parameter that is based on the average rarity of all the ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this parameters have a multiplier that can be tuned to change how much each fitness parameter affects the final fitness score\n"

    "The creation of the title takes into account the titles to crossover, and the new set of ingredients of the new recipe, since the title may contain the name of ingredients that do not exist in this new set. First of all, TF-IDF is used in the titles of the current population (parent recipes) in order to know which words are more relevant. For each title, we take one word which is an ingredient and has the highest score of them. Then for the other words, a priority queue for each title is used and ordered according to the value of the TF-IDF. Then, to decide on how many of those words are going to be in the title, we get a random number generated through a uniform distribution that is limited in the range of  [1, priority_queue.length()]. Moreover, if both titles have common words, then it is guaranteed that these words are going to be in the title unless they are ingredients that are not presented in the new recipe. Subsequently, a final check to see if there are repeated words is done. The title puts, in the beginning, the common words that both may have since it may contain adjectives, then the ingredients, and at the end, the word 'cookies' is placed. Finally, the word 'cookies' is added to the end."
