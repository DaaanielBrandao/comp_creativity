Using a cookie cutter cut the dough into cookies (whatever shapes you please). Place the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",

(It is easier to grind this way). Grind figs, raisins, orange, and apple. If the mixture is too dry or thick, mix in up to 1 cup of water, if desired. (I do not use the water, the juice from the apple and orange are enough). The spices and chopped nuts are added to the ground fig mixture. After the fig mixture is ground, I sprinkle them in over the mixture and mix (knead) it in by hand. STICKY! But good.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRoll out some dough. (should be kind of thin). Put fig mixture in a line. Wrap dough over mixture, sealing figs inside dough. Trim to desired length, using a diagonal cut. Make small diagonal slits in the sides of the cookies. Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes. (Dough makes good cookies without the filling also). Wonderful with coffee.\n",

Fold the other side in slightly past center, and press seam lightly. Pinch ends to close. Lift the loaf with a spatula and place on lightly greased cookie sheet with seam under.\nBake in 400 degree F (205 degrees C) oven for 18 - 20 minutes (top should be lightly brown). Allow to cool then cut crosswise slices about 1 inch thick.\nTo Make Glaze: Use juice of 1 lemon and enough confectioners' sugar to obtain consistency for brushing top of cookie.

Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, and mix in along with the ground toasted almonds to form a soft dough. Refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20 minutes. This will help the cookies keep their shape after pressing.\nLightly grease cookie sheets, and fill cookie press with dough. Press out cookies at least 1 inch apart depending on the size. You can experiment with different cookie designs.

Add alternately with the flour to the sugar and spices mixture. You may not need the whole 9 cups of flour but you should end up with a fairly stiff dough. Chill dough overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRoll dough out to at least 1/4-inch thick (the thicker the better), using as little flour as possible. Keep dough refrigerated when not rolling and cutting. Cut into cookies and brush with beaten egg. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Alternately, you can form the dough into golf ball size round, roll in white sugar, place on a cookie sheet and then flatten slightly.\n",

Stir in the 2 cups Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips.\nShape dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or just until edges are lightly browned. Cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks; cool completely.\nFor chocolate drizzle, in a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the 1/2 cup Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips and the shortening. Microwave on medium power (50 percent) for 1 minute. Remove and stir. If chocolate is not melted, return to microwave and repeat heating step, stirring every 30 seconds to avoid scorching. Stir until smooth. Drizzle over cookies.\nEnjoy immediately, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.\n",

Start with a tablespoon and a half of dough rolled into a little \"cigar\" shape and vary amount to fit the size of your cookie iron. It takes from one to one and a half minutes to cook each cookie - it's a trial and error process at first till you get a handle on the temperature of the gas burner and the heat retaining capabilities of your iron. A properly cooked cookie will be golden and after cooled, crisp.\nThis a family holiday tradition for us and we spend a whole day cooking cookies with lots of testing to make sure they're as good as last year's. The cast iron cookie irons work best, but I have seen people make them with the aluminum pizelle \"irons\". Ask for a krumkokie (croom cockie) iron at a gourmet cooking shop. We put them in tins and store till next Christmas, eating last year's cookies.\n",
