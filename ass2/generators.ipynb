      "Laure Anderson regarded as one of Germany's best poets is well known for their groundbreaking work on Nature, Time, and Depression. They were born in the capital on 26 April 1616. Their father, Eugene Anderson, was the country's governor, considered by many the most ruthless leader in centuries. Laure Anderson grew mostly isolated and spent the days reading and writing poetry in the family library. Their first poems dealt mainly with Nature but were only published in the last years of their life. After graduating they were exiled from the country by their father for political commentary in 1639. They moved to Faroe Islands and quickly began their new life as a poet. In the same year, they met and married the love of their life, Cleopatra Johnson. At this convoluted time, they created poems about Time that ended up being their most appraised and influential work. In 1668 the Bump Affliction devoured the nation killing more than half the population, including their spouse. After hearing the news, their father decided to give them a pardon, but Laure Anderson refused to go back and continued their poetry life. Their latest, more mature work was more oriented to Depression. After their father's death, they traveled back to Germany in 1694, but in the middle of the trip, they died of a heart disease.\n"
